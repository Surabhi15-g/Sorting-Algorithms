In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), a sorting algorithm is a method used to arrange the elements of a list (or array) in a specific order â€” usually ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest).

In Python, sorting algorithms can be implemented manually (for learning DSA) or done using built-in functions like sorted() or .sort().
